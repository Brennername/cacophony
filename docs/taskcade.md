# Cacophony Taskcade: Autonomous Local Model Arena & Code Orchestrator

## Architectural Directives & Operational Rules
- Zero Emojis in any code, comments, documentation, or commits (unless a feature explicitly declares emoji exemption).
- SOLID principles strictly enforced across all modules.
- Strict typing: TypeScript (Node.js/Bun) and modern Angular (v20+ with Signals, Zoneless, Standalone); strictly NO Python in core codebase.
- Database: PGlite (in-process WASM/Node PostgreSQL) with clean abstraction for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.
- Single-concurrency scheduler: Vega APU affinity grouping (minimizes Ollama model unloads), model failure eviction (3-4 consecutive fails), and weighted random fallback.
- Mobile-first responsive UI with Dark Mode (default), Light Mode, and High Contrast Mode adhering to Angular best practices (`docs/SKILL.md`).
- All secrets strictly confined to .env and encrypted vault.
- Zero Hardcoding & Whitebox Configurability: Any option, parameter, hyperparameter, model identifier, context limit, host, IP, or port must be configurable via typed options/config schemas with intelligent defaults, never hardcoded as arbitrary string or numeric literals.
- Network Agnosticism: Dynamic host header/IP resolution across Docker bridge, Wi-Fi LAN, VPN, and reverse proxy domains without hardcoding localhost.
- Never delete source files with rm; move deprecated files to .trash/ with justification documentation.
- Always commit changes, keep workspace clean, and ensure work is production ready.

## Taskcade Rotation & History Protocol
1. **Verification Gate**: No task is marked completed `[x]` or rotated without passing its verified automated test suite or operational validation.
2. **Archival Procedure**: When an entire phase or major milestone is fully verified, its completed checklist items are transferred from `docs/taskcade.md` to `docs/taskcade-history.md`.
3. **Traceability**: Each archived phase preserves its task IDs, descriptions, subtask trees, associated git commit hashes, and verification scope.
4. **Token Efficiency**: Active planning and execution in `docs/taskcade.md` remain uncluttered, allowing AI agents and human operators to focus directly on pending work without context exhaustion.
5. **Reference**: See [`docs/taskcade-history.md`](file:///home/nexen/projects/cacophony/docs/taskcade-history.md) for archived Phases 1 through 16.

## Phase 45: Real-Time Stream Tap Filtering, Telemetry HUD Metrics & Visual Pacing Alerts
*RDF Category: telemetry*

### T45.1: Real-Time Telemetry HUD Stream Filtering & Visual Pacing Alerts
  - [ ] T45.1.1: Implement TelemetryHudBridge in packages/engine/src/telemetry/ streaming high-frequency AMD Vega sensor readouts (VRAM, APU frequency, edge temp, PPT watts) to WebSocket/SSE clients.
  - [ ] T45.1.2: Add visual thermal pacing alert thresholds in frontend TelemetryBar for Nominal (<70C), Warm (70-79C), Elevated (80-89C), and Danger (>=90C).
  - [ ] T45.1.3: Integrate automated pacing status in DashboardViewComponent showing active model pacing delays (0s, 5s, 15s).
  - [ ] T45.1.4: Write frontend unit tests verifying reactive signal updates on telemetry threshold crossings.
